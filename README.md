Final project for CS 5007 - Introduction to Programming Concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms. 

This work focuses on generating a tight curve fitting interphase for users of different backgrounds interested in performing mathematical predictions based on experimental data. The main structure of this software is given by a python algorithm able to perform multiple regression models. The performance of each curve fitting model is studied through statistical metrics, such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and accuracy score (R2). The performance of either model would depend on the characteristics and complexity of the studied data set, so this routine provides the user with a menu of different models to choose from depending on the userâ€™s data preprocessing. However, this algorithm aids beginners in statistics by performing five different curve-fitting models in the background and recommends the user the most suitable model available for the given data set based on performance metrics. The predicted results will be graphically visualized by the user from comparative charts of the actual testing data sets and predicted models.
